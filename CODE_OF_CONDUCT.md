## Preface

In OSS projects, software needs to be maintained continuously, and
this requires a continuous effort to be devoted to the
maintenance. However, OSS developers have little or no financial
incentive to continue maintenance and development. As a result, OSS
developers stop maintaining their projects much sooner than users
expect, often abruptly. This problem is called the OSS developer
"burnout" problem.

The "burnout" of OSS developers is a frequently discussed topic, but
the real problem is that companies that use OSS commercially do not
financially support open source projects. Development and maintenance
of OSS cannot proceed unless someone contributes resources, and the
role of providing resources free of charge should not be imposed on
those who have been developing OSS. Also, by the time each prominent
OSS has achieved usable performance by commercial standards, the
developers or their employers have had to bear the development
resources. Even if a company does not expect continuous maintenance of
OSS, it should be natural that a company that uses OSS commercially
bear a part of the development resources up to that point.

Let me explain in simpler language. Imagine that you are offered a
free lunch somewhere. In such a case, a rather large number of people
would say, "Who is covering the cost of this lunch? Let me bear the
cost of what I eat." But when it comes to using OSS, the number of
such people is much smaller. And then there are those who sell what is
provided free of charge to others at a price. Certainly, as a free
lunch provider, I don't forbid that, but isn't that making too much
use of the generosity? And when I stop offering free lunch, people say
I have "burned out." Is it appropriate to call it a "burnout" when the
resources to provide free lunch have been exhausted? If those who are
making a profit give some of it back, then I can continue to offer
free lunches. I think everyone would be happier that way, don't you?
This is what I mean.

Unlike receiving a free lunch that has substance, downloading software
may seem like less of an incentive to pay a fee because you cannot see
the face of the developer and the software is only information and not
substance. However, there are real people involved in the development
and maintenance of the software, and real resources are committed for
this purpose.

Some may argue that if that is the case, then I should just make the
license noncommercial. However, if I prohibit commercial use, even if
conditionally, adopting the software will require complex
deliberations within the company. If the company is required to pay a
certain percentage of the profits earned, the paperwork for this would
become cumbersome, and it would also be necessary to publish the
figures on which the payment is based. A large part of these
deliberations is devoted to whether and how the software can be used
free of charge. Companies are, after all, profit maximizing
organizations, and the conclusion tends to be that what can be used
for free is used for free to the maximum extent possible, while
software that is not free for commercial use is not used much. There
used to be many free-of-charge software products that prohibited
commercial use, but many of them were not used much and eventually
abandoned. This is, in a sense, the tragedy of the commons, and
capitalism cannot optimize the use of OSS. A license that prohibits
commercial use does not solve the problem either.

It is undeniable that OSS and free software have become popular
because they can be used free of charge. But, if it says that
receiving a free service does not obligate you to do anything, is it
really appropriate to do absolutely nothing after receiving the free
service? If something is offered free of charge as a favor, it would
be better to pay for it in some cases, even if it is clearly marked
free of charge. In some cases, companies are making huge profits by
using OSS and free software. Isn't it strange that it is normal not to
pay for the use of OSS and free software at all even in such cases?
And the amount needed by OSS developers should be small enough
compared to what those companies usually spend on other
deals. Curiously, there seems to be a tendency to understate labor
costs that have already been agreed to be paid and to overstate new
costs that will be incurred and paid externally.

The problem of developer "burnout" becomes a problem because there is
still commercial value in the software. If the software has no value
anymore, it would not be called "burnout." In such a case, the project
simply "fades away" without anyone noticing. Would you continue to
work if no one pays you for the work you do even though there is a
demand for your work? You would quit, wouldn't you? That is not
usually called "burnout." It is not nice to talk about a user's
problem as if it were the developer's problem.

Therefore, I believe that social benefit can be maximized by nominally
allowing companies to use software free of charge for commercial use,
but still increasing awareness that a portion of the profits should be
returned to the project as a matter of morality. And I expect
companies to create and follow such a code of conduct.

Don't worry. You and companies will not be banned from this project
for violation.


## Positioning and purpose of these guidelines

These guidelines summarize the standards of practice that the
participating members of the project are expected to follow in order
to facilitate the promotion and operation of the project. These
guidelines are not a set of rules, and no penalties or other
consequences for violations are set forth in this guideline. Each
member may completely disregard these guidelines if he/she wishes. To
explain a little more for those who still feel uneasy about this, we
recognize that if you are only using the products of this project, it
does not mean that you are participating in the community, and you do
not need to concern yourself with these community guidelines at all.
In addition, there is no provision in the software distribution
license that prohibits removal of these guidelines in derivative
projects.

The primary purpose of establishing these guidelines is to encourage
companies that make commercial use of OSS or free software to create
and adhere to the following code of conduct : if a company is making
commercial use of OSS or free software, such as bundling it with their
products for sale, they should provide continuous financial support
for the project while the commercial use continues. The members of
this project are asked to help raise awareness to make this happen. In
particular, if you participate in this project as a member of a
company that makes commercial use of this software, we would greatly
appreciate your understanding of the purpose of these guidelines.

The second purpose is to prevent conflicts among the members. Although
this project is a software development project, political discussions
may be sometimes required to keep the project moving forward. Some of
the guidelines summarize the items that each member is expected to
follow in order to avoid conflicts among members and to promote calm
and smooth discussions.


## The guidelines

### Striving to change perceptions about the commercial use of OSS and free software

* Project members strive to promote the awareness that commercial use
  of open source or free software for free without any contribution is
  free-riding and should be avoided whenever possible.

* Project members strive to promote the awareness that it is natural
  for companies and other organization that make a profit from the
  commercial use of open source or free software to return a portion
  of the profit to the relevant projects as long as the commercial use
  continues.

* Project members strive to promote the awareness that it is natural
  for companies and other organizations that use open source or free
  software to contribute to relevant projects, and the organizations
  should give high recognition to their members who contribute to open
  source or free software projects on the job.

* Project members strive to promote that if a company agrees with the
  intent of these guidelines, it should post a notice so that it can
  be recognized by the general public.


### Compliance with laws

* Each member should comply with the laws of his/her own place of
  residence.
  * Each member should abide by laws of his/her own place of residence
    even if the laws do not have penal provisions.

* Each member should not follow any request of anti-social groups or
  cults.
  * The terms "antisocial organization" and "cult" herein refer to
    organizations officially recognized as such in each member's place
    of residence. The same applies hereinafter.


### Keeping calm and logical discussion

* Each member should refrain from posting a comment that is considered
  likely to cause strong emotions in those who read the comment.

* Each member should refrain from posting a comment that is not in
  line with the project's objectives.

* Each member of the project should not change the way he/she treats
  another member for any of the following reasons.
  * Discriminatory reasons (attributes that were determined at the
    time of the person's birth and cannot be changed)
  * Ideology or beliefs that are not relevant to the purpose of the
    project
    * Whether or not each participant belongs to an antisocial group
      or cult is always regarded as relevant to the purpose of the
      project. The project may ban a participant who is found to be a
      member of an anti-social organization or cult for the sole
      reason of his/her membership in such an organization.
  * Inequalities that existed in the past

* Each member of the project should treat another member equally at
  the time the action is taken.
  * In principle, affirmative action is not supported in this project.
    Imposing disadvantages on members who do not support affirmative
    action is production of new inequalities and should be avoided. If
    affirmative action must be taken, the disadvantage for it should
    be borne entirely by the supporters of affirmative action.


### To resolve the problem throughout the community

* Each member of the project should listen sincerely to the claims of
  other members that there have been violations of the above items and
  cooperates in resolving the problem.

* Project members should not leave it up to the project maintainers to
  resolve the problems.
  * The relationship between the maintainers and the other members is
    not that of parents and children. The mainteners only have the
    privileges of the websites related to the project and basically
    what you cannot do is not possible for the maintainers either.
