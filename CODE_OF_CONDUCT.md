# TLFloat Community Guidelines (version 0.2)


## Purpose and positioning of these guidelines

These guidelines summarize the standards of practice that the
participating members of the project are expected to follow in order
to facilitate the promotion and operation of the project. More
specifically, one of the purposes of establishing these guidelines is
to prevent conflicts among the members.

These guidelines are not a set of rules, and no penalties or other
consequences for violations are set forth in this guideline.


## The guidelines

### Striving to change perceptions about the commercial use of OSS and free software

* Project members strive to promote the awareness that commercial use
  of open source or free software for free without any contribution is
  free-riding and shameful.

* Project members strive to promote the awareness that if a company or
  other organization makes a profit from using open source or free
  software, it is natural for that organization to return a portion of
  the profit to the relevant projects.

* Project members strive to promote the awareness that it is natural
  for companies and other organizations to contribute to relevant
  projects if they use open source or free software, and that those
  organizations should give high recognition to their members who
  contribute to open source or free software projects on the job.


### Compliance with laws

* Each member shall comply with the laws of his/her own place of
  residence.
  * Each member should abide by laws even if the laws do not have
    penal provisions.


### Keeping calm and fair discussion

* Each member should refrain from posting a comment that is considered
  likely to cause strong emotions in those who read the comment.

* Each member should refrain from posting a comment that is not in
  line with the project's objectives.

* Each member of the project should not change the way he/she treat
  another member for any of the following reasons.
  * Discriminatory reasons (attributes that were determined at the
    time of the person's birth and cannot be changed)
  * Ideology or beliefs that are not relevant to the purpose of the
    project
  * Inequalities that existed in the past

* Each member of the project should treat another member equally at
  this point in time.
  * In principle, affirmative action is not supported in this project.
  * Imposing disadvantages on members who do not support affirmative
    action is production of new inequities and should be avoided.
  * If affirmative action must be taken, the disadvantage for it
    should be borne entirely by the supporters of affirmative action.


### To resolve the problem throughout the community

* Each member of the project should listen sincerely to the claims of
  other members that there have been violations of the above items and
  cooperates in resolving the problem.

* Project members should not leave it up to the project maintainers to
  resolve the problems.
